          <h3>The Grizzlies</h3>
          <p>Inuit youth in a small community gain a powerful sense of pride and purpose through the sport of lacrosse, in this true-story account of tenacity, renewal, and inspiring resilience.</p>
          <p>In 1998, first-time teacher Russ Sheppard (Ben Schnetzer) moves north for a job at a local school in Kugluktuk, a town struggling with one of the highest suicide rates in North America. With no previous experience or knowledge of life in the north, Russ is shocked and overwhelmed by the numerous social issues facing the youth, all as a result of the massive legacy of colonization on their families and communities. Russ introduces a lacrosse program in the school.</p>

            <h3>Gaint Little Ones</h3>
            <p>Franky (Josh Wiggins), the hero of Keith Behrman's exquisite and generous Giant Little Ones, is under more pressure than most. His life was altered when his father (Kyle MacLachlan) left his mother (Maria Bello) for a man. Franky is left confused and angry toward his father for breaking up the family. Things are further confused for Franky when his wild birthday party ends in a sexual encounter no one could have imagined, including his best friend and girlfriend. As Franky's world crumbles, he and his friends are forced to decide what kind of people they want to be.</p>

            <h3>Falls Around Her</h3>
            <p>Exhausted by years of touring the world with her band, renowned Anishinaabe musician Mary (Tantoo Cardinal) comes home to Atikameksheng Anishnawbek First Nation in northern Ontario. She returns to the land to restore herself, but her past success makes her a commodity to some, and she finds it difficult to hide from the demands of the outside world. Her sister Betty (Tina Keeper) senses there may be more to Mary’s need for isolation and urges her to reconnect with family and old friends. As Mary gets out more and even starts dating, new possibilities arise. However, the past has a way of catching up, and when Mary starts to hear disturbing noises around her cabin, she becomes paranoid that someone may be after her.

          <h3>Le Grand Bain (Sink or Swim)</h3>
          <p>Several 40-something guys, all on the verge of a mid-life crisis, decide to form their local pool's first synchronized swimming team -- for men.</p>
          <p>Gilles Lellouche’s Le Grand Bain is a hilarious and touching tale about a group of people finding purpose when all looks to be lost. In this film there is humour, drama and spectacle and it just might have you ready to dive into the water yourself. Get those swim goggles ready!</p>
